# Workshop
Pneumonia detection from Chest X-ray images using Convolution Neural Network
The dataset is organized into 3 folders (train, test, val) and categorised into 2 categories (Pneumonia/Normal). There are 5,863 X-Ray images (JPEG).  
For the analysis of chest x-ray images, all chest radiographs were initially screened for quality control by removing all low quality or unreadable scans.
